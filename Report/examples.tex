The benefits of tail recursion optimizations is evedent on  method exicutions that would otherwise run out of stack space. Consider for example the following program.

It recursevly increments i until i overflows to 0 and returns the result.
\begin{lstlisting}
class OverflowPlease {
  def makeZero( i:Int):Int = {
    if (i==0){
      i
    }else{
      this.makeZero(i+1)
    }
  }
}

object Main extends App {
  println(new OverflowPlease().makeZero(0))
}


\end{lstlisting}

Each recursion creates a new stack frame, so a stack that fits over 4 million frames would be requiered to execute this program. But with tailrecursion optimization we expect this program to sucessfully overflow i to 0 only using a couple of stack frames.

Pushing and poping stack frames is verry slow, for examlpe compared to addition. So even if we had enough stack space for 4 million frames, we would like to avoid having to push 4 million stack frams if we could avoid it. So performance is also a major bonifit of tail recursion optimization.


Here is a similar example from the lab description that recursively get the last element of a linked list:

\begin{lstlisting}
class Helper {
  def last(a: List): List = {
    if (a.hasNext()) {
      this.last(a.next())
    } else {
      a
    }
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Recursion on trees}

Recursion on tree structures is interesting because in binary trees we need to recurse on the left and right subtrees, but only the one of the recursive calls may be in the tail position. Still removing one of the recursive calls is better then none, especially if the tree tends to be unbalanced.

This example has a function that tail recursively sums the contents of the tree and another one that sets all the contents of the tree to 0.

\begin{lstlisting}
class TreeHelper {
  def countNodes(a: Tree, acc: Int): List = {
    val r:Tree = NULL;
    val l:Tree = NULL;
    val sum:Int = acc;
    if(a==NULL){
        sum
    }else{
      r=a.getRight();
      l=a.getLeft();
      sum = this.countNodes(r, acc) + sum + 1;
      this.countNodes(l, sum)
    }
  }
  
  def cleanseTree(a: Tree): List = {
    val r:Tree = NULL;
    val l:Tree = NULL;
    if(!(a==NULL)){
      a.setValue(0);
      r=a.getRight();
      l=a.getLeft();
      this.cleanseTree(r);
      this.cleanseTree(l)
    }
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{corecursive tail calls}
\label{sec:corecursionexample}

Here is an example of the more general problem that we do not initially inted to handle. Two methods \texttt{isEven(Int)} and \texttt{isOdd(Int)} use tail calls to each other to determin if the input method is odd or even.

\begin{lstlisting}
class numbers {
  def isEven(i:Int):Boolean = {
    if(i==0) True
    else     isOdd(i-1)
  }
  
  def isOdd(i:Int):Boolean = {
    if(i==1) True
    else     isEven(i-1)
  }
  
}
\end{lstlisting}
