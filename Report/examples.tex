Give code examples where your extension is useful, and describe how they work
with it. Make sure you include examples where the most intricate features of
your extension are used, so that we have an immediate understanding of what the
challenges are.

You can pretty-print Punkt0 code like this:
\begin{lstlisting}
object {
  def main(): Unit = { println(new A().foo(-41)) }
}

class A {
  def foo(i: Int): Int = {
    var j: Int = 0;
    if (i < 0) { j = 0 - i } else { j = i }
    j + 1
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

This section should convince us that you understand how your extension can be
useful and that you thought about the corner cases.
