Handling corecusive tail calls like in the even odd example in Section\ref{sec:corecursionexample} would be the obvious next step.

The benefit is that we would get improved performance and avoid some stack overflows in some corecursive programs.

But this extension is a lot more challening. The typical approach for call recursion elimination thas is simply jumping to the tail called method instead of poping and pushing stack frames would not be possible since every method in JVM has its own private address space.

One possible approach to eliminate corecursive tail calls, that would merge well with the work already done in this project, would be to implement an AST transformation that rewrites corecursive methods into a single big method that can simulate all of the methods forming the corecursion. After that, our tail recursion elimination AST transformation can be applied to the AST generated by the method merger.
