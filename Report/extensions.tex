Handling corecusvine tail calls like in the even odd example in Section\ref{sec:corecursionexample} would be the obvious next step.

The benifit is that we would get improved performance and avoud some stack overflows in some co recursive programs.

But this extension is allot more chalaning. The typical aproach for call recursion elemination of simply jumping to the tail called method insted of poping and pushing stack frames would not be possible since every method in JVM has its own private address space.

One possible apreach to eliminate corecursive tail calls that would build well on work in this project would be to implement a AST transformation that rewrites corecursive methods into a single big method that can simulate all of the methods forming the corerusion. After that our tail recursion elimination AST transformation can be aplied to the AST generated by the method merger.
