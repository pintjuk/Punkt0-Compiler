Handling co-recursive tail calls like in the even odd example in Section\ref{sec:corecursionexample} would be the obvious next step.

The benefit is that we would get improved performance and avoid some stack overflows in some co-recursive programs.

But this extension is a lot more challenging. The typical approach for call recursion elimination that is simply jumping to the tail called method instead of popping and pushing stack frames would not be possible since every method in JVM has its own private address space.

One possible approach to eliminate co-recursive tail calls, that would merge well with the work already done in this project, would be to implement an AST transformation that rewrites co-recursive methods into a single big method that can simulate all of the methods forming the co-recursion. After that, our tail recursion elimination AST transformation can be applied to the AST generated by the method merger.
