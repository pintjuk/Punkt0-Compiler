This is a very important section, you explain to us how you made it work.

\subsection{Theoretical Background}
If you are using theoretical concepts, explain them first in this subsection.
Even if they come from the course (e.g., lattices), try to explain the essential
points \emph{in your own words}. Cite any reference work you used like this
\cite{TigerBook}. This should convince us that you know the theory behind what
you coded.

\subsection{Implementation Details}
Describe all non-obvious tricks you used. Tell us what you thought was hard and
why. If it took you time to figure out the solution to a problem, it probably
means it wasn't easy and you should definitely describe the solution in detail
here. If you used what you think is a cool algorithm for some problem, tell us.
Do not however spend time describing trivial things (we know what a tree traversal
is, for instance).

After reading this section, we should be convinced that you knew what you were
doing when you wrote your extension, and that you put some extra consideration
for the harder parts.
