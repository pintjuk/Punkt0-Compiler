We chose to implement the Tail-call optimization. However general Tail-call elemination would be a complex task in JVM so we inted to start out by only implementing the sub problem of Tail-recursion optimization.

This allows us to focus on solving the problem without any changes to the existing compiler stages. We belive that all we need to do is to introduce a new compiler stage for AST rewriting, and implement tail recursion elimination as an AST transformation: from a tail recursive method to a method with a wile loop.

This stage will have to be executed after the type checking phase, seing as having the method symbols attached to method call expressions would be helpfull.
